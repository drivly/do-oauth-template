Template for Cloudflare Worker with GitHub OAuth

Visit <https://oauth.do/login> to login

## Login Flow Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as ctx-do
  participant D as database.do
  participant O as database.do<br/>(oauth-do)
  participant A as oauth.do
  D->>O: /login
  O-)github.com: /login/oauth/authorize?
  github.com-->>A: /callback
  A->>O: /login/callback
  Note over A,O: generate JWT token
  O->>D: /api
  Note over O,D: set JWT cookie
  D->>C: verify and decrypt JWT
  C--)D: return user object
```

- Because other domains have a `*/login*` route to the oauth-do worker
- `https://database.do/login` hits the `/login` route in oauth-do, and is redirected to the oauth provider:
- `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?`
- Once authorized, GitHub redirects the user back to:
- `https://oauth.do/callback` which hits the `/callback` route in oauth-do, and is redirected back to the original domain:
- `https://database.do/login/callback` which hits the `/login/callback` route in oauth-do, which then generates the JWT token, and redirects the user back to:
- `https://database.do/api` which hits the `/api` route in database-do, except now, there is a cookie in the request header, which is then passed to the CTX service bindings on ctx-do, where the JWT token is verified and decrypted, and the user object is returned:
