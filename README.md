# [oauth.do](https://oauth.do)
Template for Cloudflare Worker with GitHub OAuth


Visit <https://oauth.do/login> to login

## Login Flow Sequence:
- Because other domains have a `*/login*` route to the oauth-do worker
- `https://database.do/login` hit's the `/login` route in oauth-do, and is redirected to the oauth provider: 
- `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?`
- Once authorized, GitHub redirects the user back to:
- `https://oauth.do/callback` which hits the `/callback` route in oauth-do, and is redirected back to the original domain:
- `https://database.do/login/callback` which hits the `/login/callback` route in oauth-do, which then generates the JWT token, and redirects the user back to:
- `https://database.do/api` which hits the `/api` route in database-do, except now, there is a cookie in the request header, which is then passed to the CTX service bindings on ctx-do, where the JWT token is verified and dycrypted, and the user object is returned:
